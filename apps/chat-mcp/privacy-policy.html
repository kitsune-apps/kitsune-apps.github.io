        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Kitsune Apps ("we," "us," or "our")
          collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our mobile
          application, ChatMCP ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the
          collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy
          Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User-Initiated Data Access:</strong> The App accesses your
            device's local tools such as Calendars, Contacts, Mail, Reminders,
            and other iOS features only when you initiate such interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>LLM Provider Connections:</strong> The App enables you to
            connect with various language learning model (LLM) providers
            including Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, and others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We collect usage data through
            Firebase Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our
            App.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Core Functionality:</strong> We use the data accessed from
            your local tools solely to provide the functionality you request
            within the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party LLM Services:</strong> When you use the App to
            connect to LLM providers, data you retrieve from your local tools
            (such as calendar events, contacts, etc.) is sent to your chosen LLM
            provider to generate responses and process your requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect
            anonymous usage statistics that help us improve the App's
            functionality and user experience.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>
          ChatMCP does not store any user data on our servers. The App operates
          as an interface that facilitates communication between:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your device's local tools</li>
          <li>Your chosen LLM providers</li>
          <li>MCP servers (when applicable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any data processed remains temporary and is not retained by us after
          your session ends.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>LLM Providers:</strong> When you use the App to interact
            with LLM providers (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.), the data you
            choose to share, including content retrieved from your local tools,
            is transmitted to these third-party services. This transmission is
            necessary for the functionality you request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MCP Servers:</strong> If you utilize MCP server connections,
            data will be transmitted to these servers according to their own
            privacy practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your
            information if required to do so by law or in response to valid
            requests by public authorities.
          </li>
        </ul>
