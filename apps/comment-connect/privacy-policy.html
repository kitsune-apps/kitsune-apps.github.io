            <p>Kitsune Apps ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy
                Policy
                explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our mobile application, Comment
                Connect
                ("the App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance
                with this
                Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>a. Google OAuth: The App uses Google OAuth to authenticate users and access their YouTube account
                    data. When
                    you sign in with your Google account, we receive your basic profile information, such as your name
                    and email
                    address, as well as an access token that allows the App to interact with the YouTube Data API on
                    your
                    behalf.</li>
                <li>b. YouTube Data API: With your permission, the App accesses your YouTube account data through the
                    YouTube
                    Data API. This includes information about your YouTube comments, such as the content of the comments
                    and the
                    videos they are associated with. The App does not collect or store any other information from your
                    YouTube
                    account.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>a. Functionality: We use the information collected through Google OAuth and the YouTube Data API
                    solely to
                    provide the core functionality of the App, which includes reading and replying to YouTube comments
                    on your
                    behalf.</li>
                <li>b. No Persistence: The App does not have a server, and no information collected from the YouTube
                    Data API is
                    persisted on your mobile device. The information is only used temporarily within the App's memory to
                    facilitate the reading and replying of comments.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>a. No Third-Party Sharing: We do not share, sell, or transfer your personal information to any third
                    parties, except as required by law or to comply with legal processes.</li>
                <li>b. Service Providers: We may engage trusted third-party service providers to perform functions and
                    provide
                    services to us, such as hosting and maintenance. These service providers may have access to your
                    personal
                    information but are obligated to maintain its confidentiality and only use it for the purposes for
                    which it
                    was disclosed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information collected through the App from unauthorized
                access,
                alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
                electronic
                storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
            <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
                information
                from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
                information, we
                will take steps to delete such information.</p>
            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
                Privacy
